# LKQ NHTSA API Chrome Extension

## Overview

[LKQ](https://www.lkqpickyourpart.com/) is a national auto salvage company that has an online listing of vehicles in their yard. Although their listings are current, they sometimes lack basic information, such as engine size, number of cylinders, ect. This Chrome extension uses the [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration API](https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/) to fill in some of the missing information.
